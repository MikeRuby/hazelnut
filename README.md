## Hazelnut: A barebones starting point for Jekyll

### About this site template:
This is a [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com) template which uses Sass and CoffeeScript for assets, and Rake tasks for handy help with development. It assumes you’re using [Pow to serve your site](http://pow.cx) locally. Feel free to fork this as a jump start to your own projects.

### Websites started from this template:
[mig.io](http://mig.io), my personal site.
[humblpeied.com](http://humblepied.com), a video interview site.
[basecamp.com](http://basecamp.com), the marketing site for Basecamp.
[basecamp.com/help](http://basecamp.com/help), the help documentation site for Basecamp.

=====

### Basic `rake` commands you’ll commonly use:
`rake` to watch and update your HTML, Coffee and Sass.

`rake build` to build a clean, compressed copy of the site.

`rake view` builds a fresh copy of your site, then opens it locally.

`rake view:xip` generates an xip.io friendly URL and opens it.
